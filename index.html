    		<p class="greenH101"> Greenhouse gases are those gases in the atmosphere that raise the surface temperature of planets such as the Earth. What distinguishes them from other gases is that they absorb the wavelengths of radiation that a planet emits, resulting in the greenhouse effect.</p>
    		<p class="greenH101">Normally, the Earthâ€™s temperature is regulated by a balanced amount of greenhouse gases. However, human activities have led to an excessive amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, causing the average global temperature to rise.</p>

    			<p class="greenH101">As the issue of global warming gained prominence, there was a notable shift towards the adoption of eco-friendly products like tumblers, eco bags, and clothing crafted from recycled fibers. However, some critics argue that the enthusiasm for purchasing eco-friendly items has transformed into a form of consumption that, ironically, harms the environment. With heightened consumer interest in environmental matters, companies rushed to introduce eco-friendly product lines. These items have not only become fashionable accessories but are also produced by various brands, often serving as popular souvenirs. The persistent use of tumblers and canvas bags is now contributing to the problem of global warming. A phenomenon in which purchasing eco-friendly products actually harms the environment: Academics call this the "rebound effect".</p>
