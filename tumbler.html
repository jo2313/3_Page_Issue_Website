    		<p class="tumBler">Tumblers emerged with various appealing designs, such as cherry blossoms and Christmas themes, stoking consumers' desires to collect them. Starbucks tumblers, in particular, boasting a dedicated fan base, consistently report robust sales figures each season. Such indiscriminate purchase of tumblers is actually having a negative impact on the environment. An eye-opening revelation came from the Climate Change Research Institute, which calculated greenhouse gas emissions generated during the production of a single tumbler versus a paper cup. Astonishingly, it was found that a tumbler emits approximately 27 times more greenhouse gases than a paper cup.</p>
    		<p class="tumBler">The primary reason for this significant disparity in emissions is the material composition. Tumblers made from stainless steel, silicone rubber, and polypropylene release considerably more greenhouse gases during their manufacturing processes compared to paper or plastic cups. Additionally, emissions continue to accrue through the process of washing tumblers and disposing of discarded ones, further exacerbating the overall greenhouse gas footprint.</p>
    		<p class="tumBler">According to the Institute for life cycle energy analysis (CIRAIG), to genuinely contribute to environmental preservation, polypropylene tumblers must be used more than 50 times, and the commonly encountered stainless steel tumblers need to be used over 220 times to offset their environmental impact.</p>
